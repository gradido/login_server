At consensus, marks a contract as deleted and transfers its remaining hBars, if any, to a designated receiver. After a contract is deleted, it can no longer be called.

If the target contract is immutable (that is, was created without an admin key), then this transaction resolves to MODIFYING_IMMUTABLE_CONTRACT.

--- Signing Requirements ---
1. The admin key of the target contract must sign.
2. If the transfer account or contract has receiverSigRequired, its associated key must also sign. */
